### Hello! Welcome to my GitHub repository
My name is George. Here you can find my projects.

About me: I'm developing since higher school (in that time I used only HTML + CSS). During my education in Moscow Polytechnic University (Applied mathematics and computer science) I started learning Javascript, SQL, Python. Now I live in Hungary with my family. In general, I'm using stack: React, Redux, scss. But also I'm experienced with vue3, django, mongoDB. You can see the pinned projects, among which I have collected my best ones :)
